## Student Performance Indicator


#### Life cycle of Machine Learning Project

- Understanding the Problem Statement
- Data Collection
- Data Checks to perform
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data Pre-Processing
- Model Training
- Choose the best model

### 1) Problem statement
- This project understands how the student's performance (test scores) is affected by other variables such as Gender, Ethnicity, Parental level of education, Lunch and Test preparation course.


### 2) Data Collection
- Dataset Source - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?datasetId=74977
- The data consists of 8 columns and 1000 rows.

### 2.1 Import Data and Required Packages
####  Importing Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Warings Library.

#### Import the CSV Data as Pandas DataFrame

## Installation :hammer_and_wrench:
To set up the project environment, first clone the repository, then navigate to the project directory and run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MGJillaniMughal/Student-Performance-Predictor-Application-Using-AI-ML.git
cd Student-Performance-Predictor-Application-Using-AI-ML
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the necessary libraries to run the project.

## File Descriptions :file_folder:
- `1. EDA STUDENT PERFORMANCE.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the exploratory data analysis of student performances.
- `2. MODEL TRAINING.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook used for model training and evaluation.
- `app.py`: Python file for running the web application.
- `stud.csv`: Dataset file.
- `home.html`: HTML file for the web application's home page.

## Usage :computer:
After installing the dependencies, you can run the application using the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start a local server, and you can view the application in your web browser.
